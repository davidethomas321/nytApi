/*
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly

There are many different kinds of loops but they all do roughly the same thing:
    For statement
    do while
    while 
    labeled
    break 
    continue
    for in 
    for of 
    .forEach
    .map
*/
    //loop structure:  a) creation of an indexing variable b) a run condition c) change to the inexing variable

    //count to 10 from 0 and log the nuber:
for (let i = 0; i<= 10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
 
//loops can run infinitely
//for (let i = 0; ; i++){
 //   console.log(i);
//}

//counts to -25 by -3, starting from 2, logs the numbers
for (let i = 2; i >=-25; i = i -3){
    console.log(i);
}

//display the letters in a name individually
let name = 'kinkade';

for (let i = 0; i < name.length; i++){
    console.log(name[i]);
}

//for loops can use lots of variables:
let start = 2;
let stop = Math.floor(Math.random()*30);
let increment = 3;

for (let i = start; i <= stop; i = i + increment){
    console.log(i);
}
